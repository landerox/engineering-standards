# :material-home: Home

Welcome to the **Engineering Standards & Guidelines**.

This platform acts as the **single source of truth** for engineering decisions, architectural patterns, and operational excellence. The goal is to minimize decision fatigue by providing clear **"Golden Paths"** for building robust software.

## Architecture & Domains

Explore the standards by technical domain:

| Domain | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| :material-server: [**Backend**](backend/index.md) | Python ecosystem, API design, Data processing, and Cloud infrastructure. |

## Core Philosophy

We connect abstract **Standards** (the "What" and "Why") with concrete **Templates** (the "How"), following these principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| :material-puzzle: **Simplicity** | Straightforward solutions over unnecessary abstractions. |
| :material-sync: **Consistency** | Using the same patterns across all projects (CLI, API, or Jobs). |
| :material-robot: **Automation** | If it can be scripted, it is automated (CI/CD, Linting). |
| :material-shield-check: **Security** | Security is configured by default, not added later. |
| :material-package-variant-closed: **Reproducibility** | Environments are deterministic (using `uv`, Docker). |
