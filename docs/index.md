## About This Project

This repository serves as the single source of truth for building software in my projects. It connects abstract **Standards** (the "What" and "Why") with concrete **Templates** (the "How").

### Core Philosophy

The standards defined here are opinionated to ensure speed and maintainability.

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| :material-puzzle: **Simplicity** | Straightforward solutions over unnecessary abstractions. |
| :material-sync: **Consistency** | Using the same patterns across all projects (CLI, API, or Jobs). |
| :material-robot: **Automation** | If it can be scripted, it is automated (CI/CD, Linting). |
| :material-shield-check: **Security** | Security is configured by default, not added later. |
| :material-package-variant-closed: **Reproducibility** | Environments are deterministic (using `uv`, Docker). |
